# MenuV_ClothingMenu
 Created by Rigoormortis

# Installation
1. Move the files into your `resources` folder.
2. Rename the folder to whatever you'd like.
3. Start the resource by adding `ensure [folder name]` to your `server.cfg` file.

# NOTE:
This resource requires [MenuV](https://github.com/ThymonA/menuv) as a dependency. It will not work without it.

If you would like to save your skin to a database, you will also need a SQL handler such as [oxmysql](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql/) or something similar.
 
 -Change the settings in the queries in the `server/main.lua` file to point to a column you would like to save the data in.
